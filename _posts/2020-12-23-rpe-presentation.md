Finally!!!
==========
### Another milestone is reached!

RPE stands for *Research Proficiency Examination*. Its the qualifier exam for my Ph.D. proposal.

I ended Fall Semester of 2020 with my RPE presentation which I presented virtually on December 15, 2020 from 2 to 3 PM EST. Today, I submitted the RPE report after a week of finalizing it.
