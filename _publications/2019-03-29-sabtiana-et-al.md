Data are widely used in an organization not only for operation but also for strategic level use. Poor data quality can have negative impact for an organization such as poor decision making and planning. Therefore, data quality management becomes an issue growing today not only to the academic but also professional communities. Based on this issue, this paper presents and analyzes a case study developed in a governmental agency, BPS-Statistics of Kaur Regency. For analysis, a data quality maturity model is used to measure the implementation of data quality management in the organization. The results show that for the dimension of `Data quality expectations' is at a maturity of 4.25. `Data quality protocol' is at a maturity of 3.50. `Policies' reaches a maturity of 3.67. `Data quality protocol' and `Data standard' are at a maturity of 4.42. `Data governance' is at a maturity of 3.00. `Technology' is at a maturity 3.17. `Performance management' is at a maturity of 3.33. However, this also implies that implementing these particular dimensions will lead to a direct increase in overall maturity.
