PT Pertamina (Persero), an energy-sector company, launched an efficiency program on all fronts in 2015. Corporate Shared Service, a function which responsible for providing information technology services in Pertamina, contributes to that program by providing video conference service as a replacement for regular meetings. However, according to the Vice President of IT Operation, the provisioning of the service needs to be improved. One of the needed improvements is the need to create a formal policy and procedure for provisioning the service. Thus, this work aims to design the policy and procedure for video conference service in PT Pertamina (Persero). We employed the two-strands model of Soft-System Methodology in designing the policy and procedure. The design of the policy and procedure are based on ITIL, which is the best practice for IT service management, and ISO/IEC 20000, which is the standard for IT service management. The work produced three policy and procedure documents, and implementation strategy and change management.
