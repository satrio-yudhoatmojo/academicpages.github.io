The competitiveness level in business has risen and companies must be more resilience and competitive. Companies are expected to optimize their limited resources and focusing on their business core activities, so that they could increase the quality of their products or services. One of solutions for gaining efficiency is to outsource the peripheral services. In this study, we design a framework for measuring the success level of IT outsourcing implementation in a company. We used the framework in a our case study to assess the company's success level. Furthermore, we analyze the supporting factors for the success. In designing the framework, we use Analytic Hierarchy Process. In the result of our study, it shows that the case study is on medium level of the success level of IT outsourcing implementation.
