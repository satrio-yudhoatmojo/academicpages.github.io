Web portal's capability in information quality (IQ) will determine its success; especially in complying with user's need. On Indonesia Kreatif web portal, poor IQ can be seen by the low number of visitor penetration and engagement. The aims of this research are to identify users' perception of information quality on Indonesia Kreatif web portal and analyze their causative factors. This research was conducted in three phases: First, the dimensions of IQ was synthesized from numerous previous literatures, followed by an IQ assessment, and finalized with a thorough analysis of their causative factors. The results of this research yielded fourteen IQ dimensions. Additionally, the main causative problems include the low quantity and incomplete published information, coupled with a rigid editor team. For those problems, this research proposed the following recommendations: (1) expand information sources (2) complete the information with mandatory fields, and (3) arrange a routine time schedule from drafting to publishing.
