Nowadays, many cities around the world are moving towards the smart city by advancing the utilization of ICT and Depok is one of them. The Scottish Smart City Maturity Model, a smart city framework adapted from the IDC model and British Standard Institution PAS 181, can be used as a reference in determining the concept and direction of a smart city implementation. It identifies and measures the existing condition of a city in order to map the city's capabilities. Smart government, as a blend of technology and innovation, can be described as the next step for e-government. It is identified a vital part of the transformation towards smart city. Hence, this study aims to assess the maturity of the smart government in Depok City. This study adopts the Scottish Smart City Maturity Model using a qualitative approach that includes interviews, observations, and document analysis. This study also performs weigh calculation to determine the importance of the smart government dimension using the Entropy method. The results show that Depok is at level 1 (Ad-hoc) indicating that the city is still focusing on the development and application of ICT and on improving the use of data in its services.
