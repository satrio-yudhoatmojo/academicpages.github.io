The Master Data Management (MDM) empowers the organization to consolidate and integrate multiple master data sources into a single source of truth. Successful implementations of Master Data Management enable the organization to have standardized content that reflects business-based logic and rules processing. The goal of most MDM is to ensure that master data includes reference details that reflect the current state of the business. Master data management maturity model is a measurement of the ability of an organization for continuous improvement in master data management. The aim of this study is to measure MDM implemented in case organization with Master Data Management Maturity Model (MD3M). MD3M has five key topics and 13 focus areas. Those key topics and focus areas are designed to measure master data management maturity, each focus area has packed capabilities to be accomplished. The measurement showed that its maturity level is 0. Nevertheless, it not means that the organization did not implement MDM. The findings showed that almost 50% of the capabilities in MD3M had been implemented. By implementing further improvement about the missing capabilities, the organization will achieve higher maturity.
