In the management of its information system, XYZ Institute has launched several applications related to personnel affairs. Use of these various applications is necessary because of the specific features in each of these applications. However, problems such as redundancy and inconsistancy of employee data arose due to the absence of master data management as a single source of truth. Related to that, the research was conducted to plan the master data management in accordance with the needs of XYZ Institute in managing personnel data. Master data management planning is done by using data management body of knowledge guidance (DMBOK) which is published by Dama International in 2009 as a method. The research succeeded in formulating the need for master data management and master data source of employment at XYZ Institute. Such personnel data can be integrated using collaborative usage methods and transaction hub architecture patterns. Master data management is expected to help XYZ Institute in managing personnel data to improve data quality.
